# Bookmarks App: Marble-Keeper
## By Phoebe Law

This app was created as a solo project.

The name of this app came from me being a forgetful person and feeling like I'm always going crazy because of it. Since a bookmarks app is a list of websites you don't want to forget (thus, feel craazy), I call it a "Marble-Keeper" because it's a memory management system that helps you feel less crazy. :) Don't want anyone losing their marbles!
